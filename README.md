Working at Innovation Center Brasil at Telefonica | Vivo, in the Open Innovation Area as a Software quality assurance (SQA) lead, I play a critical role in every software produced in my company. The prior roll is to test and maintain software products before they are released for mass production or to the public. I work with a team and we've created a plan to identify, analyze and document defects, functions, errors, and more in a software. I coordinate the work with our team members, write test cases, create and execute automatic test scripts, and review computer logs or reports to identify errors.
